Hello, I am a recent graduate and I have worked as a software engineer for 2 years. I am a fast learner and an explorer.  During the last 8 months have been promoted from an intern to a senior software engineer in my current role. I am looking for an opportunity to help me grow. I would like to apply my skills to help solve problems and create business opportunities. I will appreciate your invitation for an interview in which I will gladly explain more about myself, and how I purpose to create more value and productivity to you. Thank you
